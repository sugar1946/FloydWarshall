# FloydWarshall

This project is a JAVA program that tests the efficiency of a big data tool called HAMR. 

In this project, I use FloydWarshall algorithm to find the shortest path in a direct node graph. The program is supposed to run in a distributed system that has 2 nodes at least. The key-value pair is designed to be edge-node. However, it also can be ran locally ( even though this does not make any sense in this case). After that, the program will fetch the CPU usage and time efficiency.

This program requires HAMR and other software dependies. 
Detailed documentation is included. 


HAMR is designed by ET Internationl, Inc. It is a processing engine that runs within Hadoop 2.0 as well as data discovery and business intelligence environments. It is the only real-time data-driven solution capable of dynamically pulling information directly from multiple sources simultaneously, while running both batch and real-time streaming analytics. Real-world use cases include processing and analyzing biometrics, moving life-sensing data into electronic medical records, data cleansing, fraud detection and social media analytics.

This is original a group project. My responsibility is algorithm implementation part. Therefore, feel free to discuss if anybody is interested in.
